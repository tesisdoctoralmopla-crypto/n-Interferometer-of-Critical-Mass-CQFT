# Validation and Canonical Foundations of TCG-CS-F (Article II)

## Project Overview: Unifying Quantum Collapse and Cosmic Dynamics

This paper presents a rigorous consolidation of the **Constitutive Theory of Gravity (TCG-CS-F)**, a scalar-tensor framework designed to simultaneously resolve the quantum measurement problem, unify Dark Matter and Dark Energy, and explain intermediate-field anomalies. It establishes the canonical rigor and predictive economy of the TCG-CS-F model.

The research's central claim is the **complete internal coherence** of the framework, cross-validated by providing two distinct, quantitative, and falsifiable predictions using a **single free parameter**.

## Canonical Foundations: Three Pillars of Consistency

TCG-CS-F is built upon three non-negotiable theoretical pillars to ensure **causal stability** and compliance with observational limits:

1.  **Causality:** Guaranteed by a **Canonical Kinetic Term** ($\mathbf{X}$).
2.  **PPN Screening:** Ensured by a **Unique Screening Potential** ($\mathbf{V(\chi) = M^4/\chi}$) that hides Dark Matter effects in the Solar System.
3.  **Galactic Dynamics:** Defined by a specific coupling exponent ($\mathbf{\alpha=3}$) necessary for flat galactic rotation curves.

## The Unique Coupling Constant: $\mathbf{\beta = 8.3 \times 10^{-5}}$

The entire TCG-CS-F framework is governed by a **single phenomenological free constant** ($\mathbf{\beta}$), which calibrates the intensity of the Constitutive Thrust ($\mathbf{a}_{\Phi} \propto \beta$).

| Domain | Phenomenon Explained | Validation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intermediate Field** | Non-Gravitational Comet Anomaly ($\mathbf{A_1}$) | Models $\mathbf{67\%}$ of the anomaly in 3I/ATLAS. |
| **Quantum/Cosmic Link** | Dual Falsification Targets | Provides the scale for both $\mathbf{M_{cr}}$ and $\mathbf{f}$. |

## Dual Falsifiability Strategy (The Two Fronts)

The TCG-CS-F framework is uniquely testable through two independent empirical predictions:

1.  **Quantum/Fundamental Test (CQFT):** Validated by the prediction of the **Critical Collapse Mass** ($\mathbf{M_{cr} = 10^9 \text{ amu}}$), the threshold for the **Decoherence Cliff**. This result is the core of the **Initial Work (Article I: The Interferometer Paper)**.
2.  **Cosmological/Dark Matter Test:** The predicted **Haloscope Frequency** ($\mathbf{f = 96.7 \text{ MHz}}$) for the TCG Constitutive Field.

The **Extreme Falsification Test** provides the ultimate boundary condition: the theory predicts a massive acceleration ($\mathbf{a}_{\text{predicted}} \approx \mathbf{1200 \times 10^{-8} \text{ au/day}^2}$) for comets with extreme perihelion ($\mathbf{q=0.1 \text{ au}}$). The **non-detection** of this effect would falsify $\mathbf{\beta}$ and the entire unified framework.
